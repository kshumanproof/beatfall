# Beatfall work log

Shared record for work completed by Codex and Claude. Read this file before making changes and append to it after each completed, tested change.

## Standing decisions

- `CLAUDE.md` is project history and guidance, not an immutable specification.
- Work proceeds one approved change at a time.
- The official page lockup is the Beatfall icon and wordmark together. A wordmark without the icon is stale.
- Current priority is the web application. Mobile work is out of scope until Kris explicitly returns to it.
- Functional copy should be as direct as possible. More expressive writing is reserved for places where marketing or brand voice benefits from it.
- Kris runs all Git commands. Agents do not run Git in this repository.

## 4 September 2026: Public homepage

### Requested

Add a real public homepage at `/`. Move the signed-in web application to `/app` and preserve its existing behavior.

### Changes

- Moved the existing authenticated board from `public/index.html` to `public/app.html`.
- Added a new public homepage at `public/index.html` using the official icon-plus-wordmark lockup.
- Added a concrete notes-to-board demonstration, a three-step product explanation, authorship and privacy messaging, pricing, and founder positioning.
- Updated sign-in and magic-link destinations to `/app`.
- Updated affected in-product and legal-page links so “Back to the board” goes to `/app` while page branding can return to the public homepage.

### Copy direction

- Lead with the writer's existing mess becoming a visible story.
- Keep “It asks before it guesses. It never writes your script.”
- Explain functions plainly after the headline.
- Do not market Beatfall as screenplay-generation software.

### Testing

- Served the complete `public/` folder locally and confirmed the homepage, app, sign-in, billing, privacy, and terms files all return successfully.
- Reviewed the homepage visually at desktop width and at a 390 by 844 phone-sized viewport.
- Confirmed the phone-sized page has no horizontal overflow.
- Confirmed the primary homepage call to action reaches the sign-in page.
- Confirmed existing-session and magic-link sign-in paths now target `/app`.
- Added a root-page fallback that carries a returning Supabase magic link to `/app` if the redirect allowlist has not been updated yet.
- Confirmed every page uses the official icon-plus-wordmark lockup. No standalone linked wordmarks remain.
- Confirmed the touched user-interface files contain no em dashes.
- Confirmed the homepage has no duplicate element IDs.

### Deployment note

- Add `https://beatfall.app/app` to the Supabase Authentication redirect URLs before the production domain goes live. The homepage fallback prevents a failed sign-in if Supabase temporarily falls back to the site root.

### Intentionally unchanged

- No authenticated product mechanics were redesigned.
- No mobile files were changed.
- No new product features were added.

## 4 September 2026: Homepage polish and conversion pass

### Requested

Preserve the approved homepage direction while correcting the before-and-after demonstration, tightening functional copy, polishing responsive behavior, and completing basic search and sharing metadata.

### Changes

- Rebuilt the demonstration so every After item comes from the visible Before notes.
- Added a visible “Kept in Notes” area for material that is not placed as a beat.
- Kept Theme Stated and Midpoint open to demonstrate deliberate uncertainty.
- Shortened the “Paste the whole mess” explanation.
- Changed the second step from “Review the board” to “Beatfall sorts them” and clarified where each kind of material goes.
- Changed the trust statement to the clearer “Your writing isn’t used to train AI.”
- Standardized the lower pricing call to action as “Start 14 days free.”
- Added canonical, Open Graph, and Twitter metadata.
- Added `robots.txt` and a sitemap covering the public homepage, billing, privacy, and terms pages.
- Tightened the phone hero and ensured primary phone actions meet a 44-pixel minimum target height.

### Testing

- Visually inspected the complete page at 1440-pixel desktop, 768-pixel tablet, and 390-pixel phone widths.
- Saved full-page review captures as `Claude outputs/homepage-desktop.png` and `Claude outputs/homepage-mobile.png`.
- Confirmed no horizontal overflow at tablet or phone widths.
- Confirmed the primary phone call to action is 51 pixels high.
- Confirmed exactly one H1, followed by four H2s and three H3s.
- Confirmed canonical, Open Graph, and Twitter text metadata are present.
- Confirmed `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are served successfully.
- Confirmed all conversion buttons use “Start 14 days free,” except the deliberately shorter header button.
- Confirmed no em dashes or stale wordmark-only links were introduced.

### Intentionally unchanged

- The hero wording, visual concept, section order, palette, typography, pricing, founder statement, and footer destinations remain unchanged.
- No testimonials, badges, animation, feature grid, extra tiers, or generic AI marketing were added.
- No social preview image was invented. Text sharing metadata is ready, but the image should be an approved Beatfall asset rather than an unrelated generated graphic.
